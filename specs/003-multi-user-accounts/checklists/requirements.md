# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-User Household Accounts & Shared Meal Logs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-001 through FR-015 all map to specific acceptance scenarios in user stories (FR-014 and FR-015 added from edge case answers).
- SC-006 (data isolation) is critical from a security perspective and must be validated early in implementation.
- The assumption that users belong to at most one household significantly simplifies the data model and should be revisited if household membership needs grow.
- Admin transfer on departure (last assumption) is a critical edge case to implement correctly.
